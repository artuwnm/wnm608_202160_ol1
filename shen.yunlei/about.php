			<p style="text-align:left;">We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime. They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities.</p>
			<p style="text-align:left;">As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support bookstores at the same time.</p>
			<p style="text-align:left;">We hope that Bookworms can help strengthen the fragile ecosystem and margins around bookselling and keep local bookstores an integral part of our culture and communities.</p>
